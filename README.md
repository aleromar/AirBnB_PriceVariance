 # AirBnB_PriceVariance 
An analysis of Price Variance following CRISP-DM process

-Intro
This repo contains a jupyter notebook written in python that makes an analysis on an AirBnB dataset. It focuses on price variability and how that affects overall success for a property. Here success is measured by the number of times a property is booked in any given month.

-Requirements
Python 3 with the core modules for any ML project. That is, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, etc.

-CRISP-DM
The methodology chosen to carry out this analysis is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM. This process is divided into the following phases
 1- Develop business understanding     
 2- Develop Data Understanding    
 3- Data preparation    
 4- Creating models      
 5- Evaluate those models    
 6- Deployment   
 In particular we will focus on the first five steps in this notebook
